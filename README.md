# pfch-2020-lisemails
April 2020

For pfch 2020 final @ pratt institute
Matt Millers class Spring 2020

Exported emails → .mbox from my Pratt email.
In February Pratt Information School created new listservs specifically geared
towards each of the four tracks so there were two .mbox exports created:
1. Old “All Students’ listserv
2. New LIS specific listserv

Then used python to export data from the .mbox files in a .csv
Note the exported .csv files were really messy and terminology used within the emails themselves are inconsistent which made looping through the .csv files a challenge.

Results searched for a breakdown of the number of Full-time, part-time, Internship, and volunteer opportunities sent out over the two listservs.

Then a further breakdown specifically looking at the composition of:
1. Full-time opportunities → grant funded or tenured.
2. Internships → paid or unpaid.
